Abstract: Particles within quantum materials can intricately interact, giving rise to remarkable phenomena, including superconductivity, superfluidity, and fractional quantum Hall effects. Understanding these strongly correlated phenomena is a major ongoing challenge in condensed matter physics, prompting a reevaluation of our understanding of nature. Among all materials, two-dimensional (2D) materials have exhibited its unique tunability, such as layer stacking and twisting, offering an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. An exciting example is the recent advancement in observing the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect, realized in the twisted bilayer 2H-MoTe 2 system. In this talk, I will discuss new opportunities for exploring novel quantum phenomena enabled by 2D materials and Moir√© superlattices. I will also present our ongoing efforts to design and establish an experimental system for discovering novel quantum phases and studying strongly correlated systems under extreme conditions.
